This is a turned based RPG game that was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The project was made 6 months into my coding journey and was made together with 2 classmates using Scrum planing, Daily Scrums, and retro Scrum with a 2 week deadline. 

We learned how to merge a big project, Managed the project on github and working in a team letting all voices in the group be herd. 

We made meny misstakes and it was a great learning experience and it took me and my code to the next lvl.
